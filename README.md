## What is Codes?

Codes is a **web platform designed for competitive programming practice**. Users can solve programming problems, and their solutions are automatically evaluated by our robust system.

The platform keeps a detailed **submission history**, including the status of each submission and the submitted code. Additionally, Codes provides **detailed performance statistics** and a social feature that allows users to **add friends and compare their progress**.

To enhance the learning experience, every problem comes with **detailed explanations**. Codes aims to be a key tool for anyone looking to improve their competitive programming skills in a structured and interactive way.

## Why Codes?

We created Codes to provide a comprehensive and interactive environment for competitive programmers. Our goal is to offer a platform where users can not only practice and test their skills with automatic evaluations but also learn from detailed explanations and track their progress over time. The social features encourage a collaborative learning experience, allowing users to connect with friends and compare their achievements.
